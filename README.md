• %p The void * pointer argument has to be printed in hexadecimal format.

• %d Prints a decimal (base 10) number.

• %i Prints an integer in base 10.

• %u Prints an unsigned decimal (base 10) number.

• %x Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) lowercase format.

• %X Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) uppercase format.

• %% Prints a percent sign.
